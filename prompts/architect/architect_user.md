CRITICAL!! HANDLING OF REFERENCE DATA:
For texts, slogans, names (personal, company), or recognizable faces: **DON'T COPY CONTENT** regardless of the mode.

For Design, Colors, and Styling, check the mode:
* **[INTERNAL IMAGE]:** **DON'T COPY** industry-specific elements, exact color palette, logos, or subject of images. Pay attention **only** to the design features of the image reference.
* **[USER IMAGE]:** **PRIORITIZE** the exact color palette and design DNA from the reference. However, use your **artistic judgment** to refine values if they are incomplete, technically flawed, or clash with accessibility standards.

- Only one layout option should be selected per section!
- Ensure the guidelines don't contradict the chosen layout! Be consistent on directive of elements positioning within chosen layout
Output **only valid JSON**. Do **not** include any backticks, code fences, or explanatory text.
Should always include both global and local design briefs.      

[!] IMPORTANT: COLOR PALETTE PROTOCOL:
* **[INTERNAL IMAGE]:** NEVER COPY THE COLOR PALETTE FROM THE REFERENCE! ALWAYS CREATE SOMETHING CUSTOM FOR THE REQUEST.
* **[USER IMAGE]:** PRIORITIZE THE EXACT PALETTE FROM THE BRANDBOOK. Use judgment only to ensure harmony and accessibility.
